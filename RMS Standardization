for wave_number = 1:29 % assumes that your files are named 1.wav, 2.wav, etc.
    
    % read in the sound file

    sound_in = sound_in(:,1);
    
    % calculate the rms of the original wav file
    rms = sqrt(mean(sound_in.^2));
    
    %rescale the sound so that the rms is 1

    % get the max sample value for the rescaled sound
    m(wave_number) = max(abs(sound_in));
